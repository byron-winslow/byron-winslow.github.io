            <h3>About Me</h3>
        
        <p class="homepage"> Hello, welcome to my little spot on the web. What is this Website, well it is me! That thought might seem a little confusing but to put it simply this site is things I enjoy from movies to sports. I am a marketing major and I am currently learning HTML code at the University of Maine and this is the website I am creating for an assignment. I know it's a little bland but this is the stepping stone in my website making hobby! Here is a list of some of my favorite websites below for design and layout. </p>
