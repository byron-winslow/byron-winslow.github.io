        <p><font size='5' color="white"> Hello, welcome to my little spot on the web. What is this Website, well it is me! That thought might seem a little confusing but to put it simply this site is things I enjoy from movies to sports. I am a marketing major and I am currently learning HTML code at the University of Maine and this is the website I am creating for an assignment. I know it's a little bland but this is the stepping stone in my website making hobby! I have always found website development to be interesting and the design and layout of website cool. I like to think of different ways to websites could look to be user-friendly but look appealing. I will list some of my favorite websites below for design and layout.  </font></p>
