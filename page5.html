			<th class="page5"><p class="page5">I am a pretty sporty person, I love the competition and thrill of playing and watching them. I play Soccer Basketball, Tennis, Volleyball and Pickleball. I don't mean to brag but I am very good at Pickleball I have won all five tournaments we put together last year up in Presque Isle. I have been to States once with my tennis team and once in the singles tournament. I also went to Eastern Maine for basketball but always got eliminated in the first round. When watching games I like the Oklahoma Thunder for basketball, New England Revolution, Vancouver Whitecaps for soccer and Roger Federer, Kei Nishikori and Serena Williams.

			<th class="page5"><p class="page5">I am a huge geek, I love my video games and tech stuff along with being in plenty of fandoms. I play games on my PS4 and my MacBook by running Windows 10 via boot camp. I know my way around phone pretty well, how to fix them along with computers and other technology. Also why I find making websites interesting because I feel like HTML is a gateway to learning more kinds of code. I do also want to get into filmmaking for YouTube, my brother has a channel and it is pretty successful but not sure what kind of channel I want to make yet so I am holding off but I have edited some videos for my brother and I find editing fun and relaxing weirdly enough. When it comes to fandoms I know way too much about Star Wars, Avatar the last Airbender and other shows but, hey its fun so who cares.</p></th>

			<th class="page5"><p class="page5">Making this list was hard as I love watching movies.  Going to the theater getting popcorn and soda is the place to be. Even Netflix or Hulu has some good movies to watch. I'm kinda a sucker for good documentaries but I really look for a movie that has a good story, acting, camera work and overall execution. I mean or a Transformers movie with big explosions and beautiful CGI for days! But anyway here are a 10 of my favorites in no particular order all of which I would strongly recommend if you haven't seen it, especially Star Wars.</p></th>
